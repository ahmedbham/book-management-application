# --- Database Connection ---
# JDBC Driver Class Name for PostgreSQL

# JDBC Connection URL for Azure Database for PostgreSQL (Flexible Server example)
# Get this from your Azure portal. Ensure SSL is usually required.
url: jdbc:postgresql://bookappdev001psql.postgres.database.azure.com:5432/postgres?sslmode=require

# --- Database Credentials ---
# !! IMPORTANT !!
# Avoid storing plain text passwords here in version control.
# Use environment variables, secrets management (like Azure Key Vault),
# or pass them securely via command-line arguments or prompts.
# Example using environment variables (Liquibase supports this):
# username: ${env.DB_USER}
# password: ${env.DB_PASSWORD}
# For now, using placeholders:
username: bookadmin
password: YOUR_DB_PASSWORD # <-- REPLACE or use secure method
